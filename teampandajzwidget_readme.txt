A plugin that allows users to upload and display their own recent posts as custom-post types with a thumbnail icon shown, also users can input a certain number of posts.


=== INSTALLING THE PLUGIN ===

1. Installation Process

To install our plugin you will need to upload the plugin files into your 'wp/content/plugins' folder in your local host. 

Upload the plugin folder (zipped) into your host website (for instance cPanel), and then go to your wp-admin login page.


2. Go to 'Plugins'

Log into your WP account, and click on the 'Plugins' menu item on the left handside of your dashboard.


=== ACTIVATING THE PLUGIN === 

2. Activation in WP

Our widget is named "Flower Post by Team Panda JZ", click on the hyperlink "Activate" underneath our widget name.

Input your host password, and continue the activation process to submit. 

Ta-da! The plugin is now activated on your WP account. 


=== USING OUR PLUGIN ==

1. Getting started with displaying your custom-post types (categorized by recent posts)

Now on your WP dashboard, there will be a new menu admin item called "flowerpost". Where you see "Add new flower" button link (beside "flowerpost"), click it.


2. Add New Post 

Follow the add new post instructions, and type in the text field boxes your post title and content information along with a featured image (optional) that you want.

Then click 'Publish', for this to be shown on your front end WP website.

* Note: To add a shortcode in order to show flower posts in the webpage use the following: 
	flowerpost_shortcode($atts)


3. Enter your own number of posts from 'Settings' 

Under the 'flowerpost' menu item, there is a submenu displayed (with a menu list of "All", "Add New Flower", and "Settings"), click on the settings.

From here you can input a numerical value into the text field box beside 'Post Number' to control the number of posts you want displayed in your widget. 

Then click the button link, 'Save Changes'. 

* Note: The default number of custom-post types displayed is 5. 

Enjoy the plugin!
